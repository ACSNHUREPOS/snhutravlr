# 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

## Frontend Development:
In the initial stages of the project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a static customer-facing website based on the provided wireframe. This involved creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that aligns with Travlr Getaways' vision. I also had to consider the functionality of the frontend, including client-side coding, generating request responses based on traveler search criteria, and handling user login identification.

## Backend Development:
After setting up the frontend, I focused on the server-side of the application. I set up a MongoDB database, which is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility in handling data. I created data models and a schema for data files and storage, which allowed me to store travel booking trips. I also created JSON files for seeding the database, enabling testing of the RESTful API routes. Wiring the database to the server and refactoring the code to work successfully with the frontend were crucial steps in this process.

## Advanced Frontend Development:
Once the basic frontend and backend were set up, I developed a more complex frontend to support administrative functions. This involved creating interfaces for managing the database and handling more complex tasks.

## Single-Page Application (SPA) and Security:
In the final stages of the project, I used Angular to complete the client SPA. Angular's CLI was instrumental in building components and services for the client-facing frontend. After completing the SPA, I tested it with the API to ensure the server was returning data properly. I also added a layer of security to the server-side applications, implementing web tokens for web-login authentication.

## Reflection:
This project has been a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack development. I've gained hands-on experience with the MEAN stack, developing both the frontend and backend of a web application. I've learned how to set up a NoSQL database, create a SPA with Angular, and implement security measures in a web application. These skills have not only made me a more versatile developer but also prepared me for complex full-stack development projects in the future.
